# Wheels

Useful code fragment, icons and documents for WPF & C#

**Why did we make it?**

It's rather troublesome to make same wheel when we move on new projects.

So we’d like to squeeze some time to collect some useful code fragment, icons that can help us:
1. Find common icon or resources.
2. Solve common problems of WPF or C#.

**What’s Done**

Right now it only has the icons8 example, plz join us to enrich it.
